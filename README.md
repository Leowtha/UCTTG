The system for Foundry VTT contains no rules or proprietary content from the various official RPG sourcebooks by Fantasy Flight Games. The Talents and other features within share only some nomenclature with official FFG products and cannot be used to recreate official releases as they are not reverse compatible with any FFG system on market.
